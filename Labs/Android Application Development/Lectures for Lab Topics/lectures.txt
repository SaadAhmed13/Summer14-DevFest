## Submission of programming assignments

We are using [Subversion Version Control (SVN)](http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~campbell/cs50/svn.html) for the submission of programming assignments. SVN is a tool for source code management. How are we going to submit programming labs using SVN? First, create a directory for each new lab (viz. lab1, lab2, lab3, lab3, lab5, lab6). We will make a copy of your SVN directory after the deadline for submission -- for example, lab1 should have all the folders and files just like in the ADT/Eclipse workspace.

Your svn repository root is at https://svn.cs.dartmouth.edu/classes/cs65-S13/yourreponame. For example: https://svn.cs.dartmouth.edu/classes/cs65-S13/campbell. Note, repo in yourreponame is short for respository. But replace campbell with your repsoitory account username. You should have received this from Wayne or the TA. When you click on the svn URL above you will be asked to enter a username and password: enter your full DND (also blitz name) as your username and Blitz password as your password; DO NOT use your CS account name and password to login to the svn server - it will not work.

NOTE, for classes after 2012 this is relevant: change cs65-s12 to the correct year and term for example W13 changes the svn commands below to cs65-W14.

We will not have a lecture on how to use svn so read my the notes from CS50 in advance. Once you have done this once for say Lab1 you are all set. The SVN will be perfect for the group project.

The one additional thing you have to do each week is send the apk for the project to cs65submission@cs.dartmouth.edu. Therefore to clarify; each week before the deadline you should:

1. Send the myruns1.apk to cs65submission@cs.dartmouth.edu. WARNING: your APK better work. If it crashes you will get zero grade.
2. Sign in/commit your project -- myruns1. This will include all the folders and files exactly as in your ADT/Eclipse project.

## Grading

**60% - Laboratory assignments (10% for each lab)**

There are 6 weekly laboratory assignments. Some labs are harder than others but we have a flat grading scheme across all labs. These assignments are to be done individually. The schedule is online - plan a head. You need to be organized to get through the labs and stay on schedule.

We source code solutions for all the labs. The TA will grade your solutions and write up a grade sheet on the correctness, simplicity, and clarity of your code. You have completed CS1 and CS10 so you know how to write clean code. The instructor will review the TA's grading and grade sheets. Your grade and grade sheet will be updated in the SVN in as timely a manner as we can. 
If you have questions about the grade or grade sheet please talk to the TA first. If you have concerns about grades 
see the instructor. If we decide to release code solutions please do not distribute the source code solutions we provide you with (see honor code). 

**important: if your app crashes you will get zero for the grade** 

**10% MyRuns demo day**

You will demo your completed MyRuns app. The 10% will be awarded to functionally working app. If it all works beautifully you get 10%. If some parts don't work on demo day expect <10%. If little works or the app crashes you get 0. This is a large part of the grade given to a single demo. Make sure your code is robust and functionally complete. This 10% is in addition to the 10% for lab6 (MyRuns 6).

**important: demo or your grade will die**

**20% - Dartmouth Biorhythm Project (10% for the code and 10% for the demo)** 

The project is made up of a small team (four people) and requires strong collaboration and a problem solving mindset to get the job done. Students form teams. Each member is responsible to deliver against a part of the overall system design, implementation, testing and integration.  The goals of the group project is to help you develop the confidence, skills, and habits necessary to write large computer programs while part of a multi-person team. You will become conversant in software engineering paradigms, and be exposed to various public-domain and open source tools that make the software development process easier. In addition, you will develop vital skills in self-directed learning, problem solving, and communication. The project will have a review as well as the demo. All members of the team will receive the same grade so select your team members with that in mind. 

**important: emphasis is on novelty of the app and showing a working demo -- working code is king**

## Policy for late assignments:

Unless in case of medical or family emergencies, or specific disabilities, all assignments are subject to the following policy regarding late submissions:

If your assignment is submitted late you get a 50% reduction immediately. The assignment is then graded out of the remaining 50%. No exceptions and hard dealines. Late assignments will significantly skew your final grade.

**important: Students are given two free passes for 24 hour extension *or* on 48 hour extension with no penalty. Keep these for the more challenging programming assignments. But note that by taking these free passes you are running behind on a very tight schedule**

## Policy on Joint Work and the Dartmouth Honor Code

The assignments and project are all about writing great code - shell scripts and C. Here is the policy for joint work in CS50:

First, you may discuss and help each other (e.g., help in debugging, sharing knowledge, giving moral support, getting coffee, etc.) - I promote that as the type of team spirit and joint problem solving skills that is the essence of the course and necessary to do a great project. However, you cannot work jointly on coding up (i.e., writing) your programming assignments. You can talk, discuss solutions, even show snippets of code on the white board (not the computer) to solve a problem but you cannot jointly work on the code development and writing. Submitted code for the labs has to be yours and yours alone. 

The project phase is different. You can work jointly on writing code. But you cannot take code from anywhere (e.g., the web or any other source). It has to be the joint product of the team. One caveat: no sharing of code between teams. As above, teams can discuss code, show each other snippets on the white board, but not share source code. The project phase of the course is a friendly competition so there isn't a lot of incentive to share code.

We hate to state this since you all know it but it is necessary to be explicit here (citation - culled and extended from CS8 Policy on joint work):

You would be amazed at how easy it is to tell when people work together on problem sets, particularly coding exercises. Think about the simple shell commands we run against your source code from labs and projects to compare your lab assignments and projects against every other assignment and project ever submitted since this revision of course started in 2008 - it takes less that a millisecond to run these checks - no effort on our behalf. Similarly, we know how to use google too. You should not under any circumstance look at or use code from students that have previously taken CS50. The message is simple - please don't make life unpleasant for all of us by breaking these rules. The penalties for cheating at Dartmouth are severe, starting with suspension and including expulsion. If you are unsure about anything, please ask.
We take the Honor Code very seriously, so please, if you are unclear on any matter regarding this policy, do not hesitate to see me in office hours, and we will be more than happy to answer your questions. 

## Book

[The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development](http://commonsware.com/Android/)

It is an online book $45.00

![](images/androidbook.png)

I like the online book because you pay once and you get the revised versions for free (sort of). This is important because the APIs are still fluid. Many APIs are being added and depreciated at the same time. It is a bit of a nightmare. So the book at least quickly tracks major changes.

I really like this other books too. The first one is more introductory -- the second, more depth, more kungfu. But if you want to go deeper after this class buy both.
